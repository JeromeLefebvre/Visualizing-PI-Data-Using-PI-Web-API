            "description": "PI Web API is actually made of two different services. One service that we have used so far that returns data about attributes, elements and such. The other creates an index of your PI System. In other words, it creates a small database that contains information regarding all your elements, tags, etc. You can query this database using a set of filters that can return information such all elements that start with the letter A or all tags with location1=4 and pointType=OPC.\n\n\nLet's look at the example that is already filled in the URL below by hittin the ```Params``` button.\nWe see that q (standing in for query) is ```name:s*``` which means, return all everything that starts with the letter \"s\". The \"*\" is a wildcard character.\n\nThe scope paramter restrict where the data comes from, in this case it is ```pi:PISRV1```, this case the results must come from the PI Data Archive \"PISRV1\".\n\nThus we are retrieving all tags that start with the letter \"s\". Hit send to confirm this.\n\nTo restrict what is being queried, we can add more fields to our query. For example, we can add an other name field to require that we are looking at tags that only start with a \"s\" and end with a \"u\". This is done by simply adding a ```AND``` conditional and writting it as ```name:s* AND name:*u```.\n\nExercises:\n1. Look for all tags that have point source R\n2. Return only the first 5 of such tags. (use the [```count```](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/help/topics/search-queries) paramter for this)\n3. For each tag found, only return the links. (this uses the [```fields```](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/help/controllers/search/actions/query) parameters which is more limited than selectFields we have used so far.)"

One as an \"[API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)\", that is as something accepts requests and returns data, the other as a \"[service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing))\" that can be used interactively. The service approach is particularly helpful when you want to quickly browse around what is available within PI Web API, and more importantly, when you want to view the help file.\r\n\r\nTo access PI Web API as a service, you simply need to open <https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/> in your favorite browser and enter the credentials below. The page you have just opened is commonly called the \"PI Web API's Homepage\".\r\n\r\nUsername: ```webapiuser```\r\n\r\nPassword: ```!try3.14webapi!```\r\n\r\n**Exercise**:\r\n1. Open the the [PI Web API Homepage](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/) in your favorite browser and enter the credentials above.\r\n1. We will not go into the details of the authentication for this training, but for this training we are using [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). In other words, with each single request we are sending a username and password to PI Web API service (as we are also using https, this information is encrypted before being sent). To see this, expand the ```Headers``` tab within Postman and look at the ```Authorization``` key. The value is the username and password encoded in [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64), to view it in a human-readable style we can use [ACM's REST API](https://helloacm.com/api/base64-decode/?s=d2ViYXBpdXNlcjohdHJ5My4xNHdlYmFwaSE=).\r\n2.

The terms \"controllers\" and \"action\" are frequently used in Rest APIs, the usage in PI Web API follows the [convention of ASP.net](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd410269(v=vs.98).aspx).\r\n5. Click on the [GetByPath](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/help/controllers/assetserver/actions/getbypath) action.\r\n6.

In Postman, to complete the URL already defined below, click \"Params\" to the right of the URL. In the key enter ```path``` and in the value type in ```\\\\PISRV1\\UCDavisBuildings```.

First, let's look at the documentation on the  [GetRecorded](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/help/controllers/stream/actions/getrecorded) action, the action that allows us to retrieve recorded values from a tag or attribute. We can get the required URL for this action, by using the ones provided in the ```Links``` collection of an attribute. In this exercise, we are using links that were accessed in the previous exercise. Rich data access ([RDA](https://pisquare.osisoft.com/community/developers-club/blog/2012/02/10/pi-af-sdk-rich-data-access)) is the term that we commonly use to talk about all the ways data from a tag can be retrieved.\r\n\r\nFirst read over the various available URL parameters. Pay particular attention to the default values (for example, the default start time is \"*-1d\" when written in [PI Time](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/help/topics/time-strings))\r\n\r\n**Exercise**:\r\n1. To customize this query, change the default time to one week prior starting from this morning.\r\n2. Also change the endTime to this morning at midnight.\r\n3. Let's now switch from recorded values to [summary values](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/help/controllers/stream/actions/getsummary) what needs to be changed? You can retrieve the link from exercise 3 as well.\r\n4. We now have a query that returns to us a single summary for the previous seven days. To get a daily summary, use in the ```summaryDuration``` key and set it to ```1d```.\r\n5. We can also see that the JSON package is quite long. To reduce it, we can use the [selectedFields](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/help/topics/selected-fields). Add in a new the ```selectedFields``` Key with value ```Items.Value.Timestamp```. \r\n5. With this request, we are only retrieving the timestamps, change the request to also retrieve the values.\r\n6. In this training, we are using data from the university of [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), which is in California. The PI Web API endpoint is located in the East Coast of the US. Furthermore, you are most probably located in a region with yet another time zone. The timestamps that are retrieved from PI Web API are all in UTC Time by default. To see the timestamps as they originate from the UC Davis campus, we need to add in the ```timeZone``` URL parameter along with the value of ```Pacific Standard Time```.

        "description": "It is very common to want the values associated to a certain attribute, but following what we have done so far, we would first have to load up the attribute to retrieve the link for the type of data we are interested in. This would force us to make extra requests against PI Web API. This is such a common scenario, that PI Web API introduced [batch requests](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/help/controllers/batch/actions/execute), which allows multiple requests to be collected into a single request.\r\n\r\nFor the previous exercise we used the [Get method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods), but for batch request we need to use the [Post method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)). The reason being simple, including the information about multiple requests into a single URL would be tremendously impractical. Including multiple request into the body of the POST request is much more sensible. The format of such a request, is of course, in JSON.\r\n\r\nA side benefit of using Batch request is that we can send all requests to the same URL, this can greatly simplify deploying PI Web API.\r\n\r\nThe syntax of batch requests can be a bit complicated, but the idea is that it is a collection of requests that can depend on each other. For each sub-request, there are thus information about the request itself and how this sub-request depends on other sub-requests. Let's look first at the simplest batch request which contains only a single sub-request.\r\n\r\n**Exercise**:\r\n1. Execute the request itself and look at the result and the status code. The status code is now 207, meaning that the response includes multiple statuses and those statuses are found in the body of the response. If you look at the response's body, you should see a status code of 200, which means the one sub-request included in the batch successfully went through.\r\n2. Now let's look deeper in to the request itself, first we notice that that in the body we have a main part called \"getAttribute\" (the name of the sub-request), the http method used, and the resource which is the URL of the sub-request.\r\n3. Edit the URL of the sub-request (not the batch request URL), so that we can retrieve only the SummaryData link."

Notice that the \"getData\" part of the request is returned first, this is in part due that there are no dependence set up between the two sub-request and thus no natural order for which the data to be returned.\r\n1. We want to specify that the \"getData\" sub-request will depend on the getAttribute sub-requests. To add in a dependence, add in the following after the Resource line of getData.\r\n``` \"ParentIds\": [\"getAttribute\"] ```\r\nOnce you do so, you should see a red X next to the previous line in the JSON editor. This specifies that there is a syntax error in the JSON syntax. The error is that every entry needs to be comma separated. Thus, you need to add in a comma at the end of the \"Resource\" line.\r\n1. Now that the two sub-requests are dependent on each other, we can grab the link that is collected in the getAttribute sub-request and use it in the getData sub-request. To do so we further add in:\r\n``` \"Parameters\": [\"$.getAttribute.Content.Links.SummaryData\"] ```. The ```$``` is a commonly used variable in JavaScript, in batch requests, it referes to the top level JSON object.\r\n1. We now need to use the link that we have retrieved. To do so, replace the everything before the ```?``` in the URL included in the getData sub-request with simply ```{0}```. ```{0}``` stands for the first parameter in the ```Parameters``` list."

        "description": "You are now ready to move on to the final exercise.\nThe final exercise is to visit [amCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/) and select a symbol that you would like to use to displays information coming from your PI System. The [JavaScript Charts](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/#javascript-charts) will be the one of particular interest.\n\nThis can be quite challenging if you are not experienced with JavaScript and related technologies. You can also watch the following video to see the though process that I use when creating such symbols.\n\nThis final exercise can be completed as many times as you want. First select a symbol that displays information from a single attribute (ex: [a chart](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/date-based-data/)), then a symbol that displays data from multiple attributes or tags(ex: [a pie chart](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/simple-pie-chart/)), and then information regarding elements (ex: elements that have [longitude and lattitude](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/map-dynamic-pie-charts/)) or event frames (ex: a [Gantt chart](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/gantt-chart-dates/)).\n\n1. In the JSFiddle view for your select symbol, determine where the data is located and experiment with changing some values.\n1. For your selected symbol, determine if the data that needs to be represented should come from the attribute's recorded values, plot values (ex: a [chart](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/date-based-data/)), or maybe current value (ex: [gauge](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/animated-gauge/) symbol)? Take a look at the [stream controller](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/help/controllers/stream) for the details on the various RDA methods.\n2. Edit the batch request below to fetch the appropriate data for your symbol. You may also change the attribute to any other symbol (maybe everybody's favorite tags sinusoid or cdt158)\n3. Add in code to retrieve this data into JSFiddle. (you can fork the examples that were listed before)\n4. Now we need to extract the data coming from PI Web API into a form that can be used by the AMChart symbol. You can use jsonPath as in example in exercise 6 or loop over the data. If this proves hard, instead of writing some code, use the reponse that you get in Postman, edit that response and use that as the dataProvider property in your symbol.\n\n\nTo work directly with a HTML file, you can also try [amChart's Chart Maker](https://live.amcharts.com/).\n\nFinally, share your work with us! To do, so post for your JSFiddle and add in a comment containing it.\n\nIf you use the code generated by Postman, you will need to add the [jQuery library](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js) as a refrence."

The other creates an index of your PI System. In other words, it creates a small database that contains information regarding all your elements, tags, etc. You can query this database using a set of filters that can return information such all elements that start with the letter A or all tags with location1=4 and pointType=OPC.\n\n\nLet's look at the example that is already filled in the URL below by hittin the ```Params``` button.\nWe see that q (standing in for query) is ```name:s*``` which means, return all everything that starts with the letter \"s\". The \"*\" is a wildcard character.\n\nThe scope paramter restrict where the data comes from, in this case it is ```pi:PISRV1```, this case the results must come from the PI Data Archive \"PISRV1\".\n\nThus we are retrieving all tags that start with the letter \"s\". Hit send to confirm this.\n\nTo restrict what is being queried, we can add more fields to our query. For example, we can add an other name field to require that we are looking at tags that only start with a \"s\" and end with a \"u\". This is done by simply adding a ```AND``` conditional and writting it as ```name:s* AND name:*u```.\n\nExercises:\n1. Look for all tags that have point source R\n2. Return only the first 5 of such tags. (use the [```count```](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/help/topics/search-queries) paramter for this)\n3. For each tag found, only return the links. (this uses the [```fields```](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/help/controllers/search/actions/query) parameters which is more limited than selectFields we have used so far.)"

        "description": "PI Web API is actually made of two different services. One service that we have used so far that returns data about attributes, elements and such. The other creates an index of your PI System. In other words, it creates a small database that contains information regarding all your elements, tags, etc. You can query this database using a set of filters that can return information such all elements that start with the letter A or all tags with location1=4 and pointType=OPC.\n\n\nLet's look at the example that is already filled in the URL below by hittin the ```Params``` button.\nWe see that q (standing in for query) is ```name:s*``` which means, return all everything that starts with the letter \"s\". The \"*\" is a wildcard character.\n\nThe scope paramter restrict where the data comes from, in this case it is ```pi:PISRV1```, this case the results must come from the PI Data Archive \"PISRV1\".\n\nThus we are retrieving all tags that start with the letter \"s\". Hit send to confirm this.\n\nTo restrict what is being queried, we can add more fields to our query. For example, we can add an other name field to require that we are looking at tags that only start with a \"s\" and end with a \"u\". This is done by simply adding a ```AND``` conditional and writting it as ```name:s* AND name:*u```.\n\nExercises:\n1. Look for all tags that have point source R\n2. Return only the first 5 of such tags. (use the [```count```](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/help/topics/search-queries) paramter for this)\n3. For each tag found, only return the links. (this uses the [```fields```](https://devdata.osisoft.com/piwebapi/help/controllers/search/actions/query) parameters which is more limited than selectFields we have used so far.)"
